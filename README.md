# MyCocktails  
### App Description  
This is an App for the final project of the course *"Android Kotlin Developer"* by **Udacity**.

The App will help the user to choose a cocktail, see it's recipe, learn how to make that cocktail and mark it as a favorite if the user like it. 
It consists in having a list of cocktails for the user to choose and by clicking the cocktail the user will see a detail screen with an image, recipe and instructions on how to create that cocktail.
The list will permit the user to mark their favorite cocktails and have them in a separate screen with the dedicated list for that purpose.

The code is under MIT License so everyone is free to have a look. You can fork, copy and use the code as you please.

For learning purpose the App will contain a login page in a FirebaseUI personalized style. The user will have the possibility to login by entering an email or login with their Google account.

Thanks to [**The Cocktail DB**](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php/) for their API! -> Please have a look!

> **Note:** The App is under **Development** and it is not ready for use. This is the Master branch only when the app is in this branch it will be ready for use!
